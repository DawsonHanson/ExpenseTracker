About:
Expense Tracker was created using Java swing, with the goal of giving
the user a simple, easy to use application to aid in tracking expenses.

*Feel free to use the source code, please keep in mind that external libraries
from other creators are used.

If you would like to use the application as is, either on Linux or Windows, 
please follow below instructions.

*Java needs to be installed in order for the jar file "expensetracker.jar" to run.
visit "https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/" and follow their instructions.

Place the expensetracker.jar file in a new folder. To launch the application 
double-click the jar file. 

On launch, a new folder will be created named "expense_files". Its location will 
be relative to the jar file. This folder will store all files created from application 
use. It is safe to delete this folder, as if not present on launch, a new one will be created.
